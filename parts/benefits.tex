\section{Benefits and challenges of using LOD at TUWien (RQ2 \& RQ3)}
As mentioned in the introduction, we identified \textit{students}, \textit{researchers} and \textit{administration employees} as import stakeholders at a university. This chapter describes the methodology and results of the conducted case study involing researcher. The essential question of the case study was RQ2 (``\textit{What are major benefits and barriers for each stakeholder and what are useful use cases?}'') and RQ3 (``\textit{What are major challenges for the implementation of a Linked Open Data solution?}'') 
A case study concerning students was conducted by Kevin Haller~\cite{article:haller_publishing_2016} and another one concerning administration employees by Stefan Gamerith~\cite{article:gamerith_publishing_2016}.
The first section of this chapter describes the applied methodology (see section~\ref{methodology}). The second section evaluates and analyzes the results of the case study, investigating the possible benefits, barriers and disadvantages of some use cases and a general view at the interviewees (see section~\ref{results}).
