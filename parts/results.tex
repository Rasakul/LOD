\paragraph{Use case}
\%\%\%\%TODO: more interlinking with LD4L\%\%\%\%
This question aimed for a use case similar to the project Linked Data Libraries (described in Section ~\ref{ld-libraries}). The proposed scenarios was to publish the data or meta-data of the university library (and all of its specialized libraries) as LOD and provide an application to access the data. A further option of this scenario would be an interlink to other LOD data sets, e.g. from the publisher "`Springer"'.

\paragraph{Statistically evaluation}
It can be seen in Figure~\ref{Fi:lib-data} that the interviewed persons strongly agreed to the scenario (found it "`extremely useful"') and could imagine a similar project at the TU Vienna. Only one interviewee found it difficult to see advantages and therefore argued that he wouldn't use it. Another one found it indeed useful in a general context but not for his own work.

\paragraph{Needs, potential benefits}
As stated, all of the interviewed persons could imagine a similar project. One of the main reasons of the strong acceptance was the current interface of the library website~\footnote{\url{www.ub.tuwien.ac.at/}}, which only allows a search with only a few, specified parameters (see Figure~\ref{Fi:UB_TU}). Also the physical search in the library itself was claimed due to a lack of orientation and knowledge about the position of e.g. a searched book. Both point of criticism are expected to vanish by an open access to the data and appropriate applications, which provides a detailed and personalizable search interface.\newline
Furthermore an open access to the data was seen as a chance for everyone to interact with it and as opportunity to stimulate creativity of the people.

\paragraph{Barriers, potential disadvantages}

The library institution was very conservative perceived with skepticism, refusals and resentment against new ideas, especially in a technical term. It was stated by some interviewees, that this kind of project would only be seen as an extra amount of work in the library and not as an opportunity.\newline
Beside the expected opposition there was also a real amount of work estimated by the interviewees. In particular there would be an effort to invest in digitizing books and keep this data up-to-date. This would be an important part of the project, otherwise the data would loose there value - not digitized data could not be distinguishable from not available data. Therefore it would be essential to have a complete and current database. \newline
Another concern of the interviewed people were the copyright of the data. However, this problem was seen as handleable, because only meta-data would be open accessible.\newline
At last, one interviewee declined the idea and usefulness of the LD4L and similar projects because of the existing platform Google Scholar~\footnote{\url{www.scholar.google.at/}}. He stated, that it already provides similar data and therefore everything he needs for his work. Further a additional platform would be too intricate to use.

\subsubsection{Data from the Publication database}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Use case}\label{section:pub_db_usecase}
\%\%\%\%TODO: interlinking with open science and/or Open Research Online\%\%\%\%
The proposed use case applied to the already existing publication database of the university. In the current state the database can be accessed via its website~\footnote{\url{www.publik.tuwien.ac.at/pubstart.php}}, where a interface for search exists. For other search parameters a request to the administration has to be made. The introduced LOD approach provides an LOD interface to the existing database, so the data can be accessed over e.g. SPARQL.

\paragraph{Statistically evaluation}
Similar to the library use case the interviewees liked the idea and found it all "`extremely useful"'. Everyone could imagine such a project at TUVienna and would also use it.

		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Needs, potential benefits}
In contrast to the previous use case,the work amount of work was significant lesser stated, because the data are already there, just as the need of being up-to-date of the database.\newline 
Further some of the interviewed persons (independent to each other) come up with the idea of building an application based on the Linked Open Data interface to provide an overview of a researcher references as a widget or similar for a personal website. The data could be interlinked e.g. with the LOD interface of the Springer publisher~\footnote{\url{www.lod.springer.com/}} and complemented by including the Journal Impact Factor (JIF).

\paragraph{Barriers, potential disadvantages}
The interviewees identified uniformly a problem with the data ownership. Although there is an administration of the database, the \textit{ownership} of the data itself is very unclear and therefore a contact and responsible person would be hard to find for such a project - there needs to be more investigation.\newline
Another point, some of the interviewed persons were concerned of, was quality assurance - to use the data, they need to be synchronized with the original database. To taking care of this point, the implementation of a similar project has to ensure this.
