\subsection{Linked Universities}\label{linkeduniversities}
One of the most important university projects in the world of LD are the LinkedUniversities. They are "`\textit{an alliance of european universities engaged into exposing their public data as linked data}"'\citet{url:linkeduniversities}, providing help and knowledge for other universities who wants to implement LD-Systems in their infrastructure. Addressing the problem of connecting data and developing new sites by inexperienced universities, the alliance provide information so they don't have to be re-learned. For this purpose the LinkedUniversities offering a portal as collaborative space with common vocabularies and practices for reusing, describing and sharing.

Their goals are:~\footnote{\citet{url:linkeduniversities}}

\begin{itemize}
\item "`Identify, support and develop common linked data vocabularies, usable accross universities for common concepts such as courses, qualifications, educational material, etc."'
\item "`Describe reusable recipes, and share reusable tools, for exposing linked data in universities"'
\item "`Support, through experience sharing and reuse, initiatives towards exposing university data as linked data"'
\end{itemize}


The members of this alliance are:(~\footnote{\citet{url:linked-universities-members}})

\subsubsection{Example: The Open University and the LUCERO Project}
LUCERO (Linking University Content for Education and Research Online) was a project from the Open University, funded for 1 year by the JISC Information Environment 2011 Programme under the call Deposit of research outputs and Exposing digital content for education and research. Aim of the project was to "` \textit{ scope, prototype, pilot and evaluate reusable, cost-effective solutions relying on linked data for exposing and connecting educational and research content}"'~\footnote{\citet{url:lucero}}. The projects connected with other organizations through LinkedUniversities.org to gather common issues and practices. They outcome was the first university linked data platform, \url{http://data.open.ac.uk/}, with much impact on The Open University and the education community.
